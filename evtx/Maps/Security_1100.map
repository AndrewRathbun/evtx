Description: The event logging service has shut down
EventId: 1100
Channel: Security
Provider: "Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog"
Maps:
  - 
    Property: PayloadData1
    PropertyValue: "%ServiceShutdown%"
    Values: 
      - 
        Name: ServiceShutdown
        Value: "/Event/UserData[@Name=\"ServiceShutdown\"]"

# Please note, Event Log 4609 (Computer is shutting down) doesn't get logged anymore due to this service being shut down first. 
# Therefore, 4609 never gets a chance to get logged. This log is effectively your time of computer shutdown, as a result.
# This map likely won't log any data in PayloadData1, but at least this map will provide the Map Description column with something.

# EVTX parser

This project contains both the core parsing engine as well as a command line front end that uses it.

For documentation on creating maps, check out the [README](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/evtx/blob/master/evtx/Maps/!!!!README.md) in the Maps directory. 

Use the [Guide](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/evtx/blob/master/evtx/Maps/!Channel-Name_Provider-Name_EventID.guide) to learn how to make maps from the [Template](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/evtx/blob/master/evtx/Maps/!Channel-Name_Provider-Name_EventID.template) provided.
